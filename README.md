Exercises for the DOST Summer School on AI held June 2-9, 2017.

## SVM

Books

* Learning from data
* Teknomo - Intro to SVM

- Algo that classify both linear and nonlinear data maximizing distance betwween

Hyperplane

- plane that bisects closest points

` w'x + b = 0`

` w = d - c`

* in R^n, subspace of n-1
* linear kernel `f(x) = w'x + b`

support vectors

* points near closest points to hyperplane
* high quality data

SVM is great with a small number of classes
